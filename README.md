# Timeline Widget Example

This is a starter widget template using ***Create React App*** and TypeScript

The implementation is using our **TextKit React SDK**

For more information please checkout our documentation at [TextKit](https://docs.textkit.io)

---

## How It's Structured

The `App.tsx` file contains the entry point that uses our `TextKitWidgetProvider`. 

This is where you can setup your default `Header, Footer and/or Label`

The `Widget.tsx` file is where your widget code exists you are free to update this file to your desire. 

You will notice the usage of our `useTextKit` hook which allows you to access the state and different functions you can perform. Please refer to our documentation for more details.
